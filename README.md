# iVentoy Container

## tl;dr – I’ve moved on. 

I’m now trying to build a proper, open-source PXE server in Go that doesn’t do anything shifty behind your back. Check it out:

👉 https://github.com/garybowers/bootimus

It’s cross-platform (ARM/AMD64), transparent, and won't mess with your boot images in a way you can't understand. Feedback is very welcome!

## ⚠️ A bit of a warning

This repo started as a way to containerise iVentoy, but I can’t in good conscience recommend it anymore.

The biggest issue is what’s happening under the bonnet. iVentoy is closed-source and has been caught silently injecting "black box" drivers and certificates into the boot process without any disclosure. We’re talking about kernel-level drivers and fake root CAs being shoved into your WinPE/Linux runtime at boot.

From an infosec perspective, that’s a massive red flag. You’re essentially letting an opaque binary patch your operating system before it’s even installed.

Why this is a problem:
Silent Injections: It patches your images at boot time with files we can’t audit.

Security "Hacks": It uses dodgy techniques (like fake EV certificates) to bypass Windows signature checks (see Issue #106 and #118).

Zero Transparency: Because it’s a closed binary, we’ve no way of knowing if it’s "phoning home" or what else it might be dropping into your environment.

Use at your own peril. If you want a PXE solution that’s actually trustworthy and 100% OSS, give Bootimus a go instead. No nonsense, no hidden drivers—just a clean boot.


# Iventoy Container

This is a docker container packaging up the iVentoy tool [https://iventoy.com](https://iventoy.com)

The image is based on Debian 12 Bookworm slim version and uses supervisor to launch the process.

Note: The way iVentoy has been developed is really weird, there's no daemon or flags (I can find), so just ignore supervisor warnings for now.

## Versions

Docker Tag:
* 1.0.20-1 : iVentoy v1.0.20,  Logs symlinked from /iventoy/log/log.txt to syslog
* 1.0.20   : iVentoy v1.0.20
* 1.0.19   : iVentoy v1.0.19

## Usage

It uses sysvfs so the container needs to be ran in privileged mode (not ideal!) and also needs port 69 which is in a privileged range.

### DHCP

By default, I can't find a way of manipulating the configuration at first start.  Unfortunately iVentoy operates it's own DHCP server and will need to be configured to use a external DHCP server in the configuration.

For configuration of various DHCP servers see the [docs/](docs) folder.

### Ports 

The default web admin endpoint port is 26000 and can be hit using a browser pointing to http://<ip>or<localhost>:26000 in Chrome. 

The default internal iVentoy webserver for serving images is 16000 this is configurable in the admin interface documented here [https://iventoy.com/en/doc_http_url.html](https://iventoy.com/en/doc_http_url.html), if changing ensure you forward the correct port number

Port 10809 is Linux Network Block Device - I'm not quite sure what iVentoy uses it for, I'm going to assume to mount EFI or ISO's.

  - 69/69 UDP = TFTP Port
  - 26000/26000 TCP = iVentoy Web GUI Interface
  - 16000/16000 TCP = iVentoy iso & file server
  - 10809/10809 TCP = Block Device

## Volumes

There are a couple of volumes you can mount, the primary is the `iso` folder, which surprisingly containts your iso images you want to boot.

```
docker run -d --privileged -p 69:69 -p 26000:26000 -p 16000:16000 -p 10809:10809 -v /path/to/iso:/iventoy/iso garybowers/iventoy:latest
```

### Persisting Configuration

Another oddity with iVentoy it looks for a /iventoy/data/iventoy.dat file and if that doesn't exist on boot it will fail to load, this causes a issue wanting to persist the /iventoy/data folder.

1. Run iVentoy without the data volume mapped 
```
docker run -d --privileged -p 69:69 -p 26000:26000 -p 16000:16000 -p 10809:10809 -v /path/to/isos:/iventoy/iso --name iventoy-tmp garybowers/iventoy:latest
```

copy the contents of the data folder to your persistent storage

```
sudo docker cp iventoy-tmp:/iventoy/data/iventoy.dat /my/local/storage/iventoy/data/
sudo docker cp iventoy-tmp:/iventoy/data/config.dat /my/local/storage/iventoy/data/   <---[Might not exist, skip if not]
sudo docker cp iventoy-tmp:/iventoy/data/mac.db /my/local/storage/iventoy/data/
```

delete the temporary container

```
docker rm iventoy-tmp --force
```

Run iVentoy with the volume for data mounted.

```
docker run -d --privileged -p 69:69 -p 26000:26000 -p 16000:16000 -p 10809:10809 -v /path/to/isos:/iventoy/iso -v /path/to/data:/iventoy/data --name iventoy garybowers/iventoy:latest
```

Alternatively run on host mode to serve PXE to docker host's LAN:

```
docker run -d --privileged --net=host -v /path/to/isos:/iventoy/iso -v /path/to/data:/iventoy/data --name iventoy garybowers/iventoy:latest
```

### Configure your DHCP server
See the [docs](docs/) folder for examples.

### Configure iVentoy

Once your container is up and running go to the IP address of your server on port 26000 e.g. http://10.0.0.1:26000

1. Ensure the Server IP is selected correctly, on my docker setup I have a dedicated network with it's own IP for this service.

2. On the configuration menu on the left, If you are using a external DHCP server then ensure the `DHCP Server Mode` is set to `External`

3. Copy a ISO file to your isos folder (locally as set by the volumes above) and goito the `Image Management` menu on the left and hit refresh.

4. Start the server by hitting the bit play button on the `Boot Information` menu screen

5. Test booting.
